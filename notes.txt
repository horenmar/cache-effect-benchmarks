Why: ACM short presentation
What: measurement of performance effects caused by picking different data structures
      or different algorithms, with the same algorithmical complexity.

Measurements: 1) Matrix multiplication, the naive implementation vs bit smarter,
                 work duplicating implementation.
			-- Done
              2) Read only rb-tree based map, vs array-based flat map.
              3) Heavy read, rare writes on the same. (100 reads : 1 write)
              4) Equal read to write ratio on the same. (1 read : 1 write)
              5) Iterating (summing) over a sequence
                  a) As an array
			-- Done
                  b) As a list
			-- Done
                  c) In reverse order
			-- Done
                  d) In random order
			-- Done
              6) Skipping work while iterating an array.
			--Done
